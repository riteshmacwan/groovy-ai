They listen for incoming client requests on specified ports and respond with the requested resources, such as HTML files, images, or API data. Popular HTTP servers include Apache, Nginx, and those built using Node.js."},{"role":"assistant","content":"How do you set up a basic Express.js server?"},{"role":"user","content":"First, initialize a new Node.js project and install Express using npm. Then, create a file (e.g., server.js) and require Express. Instantiate an Express application by calling express(). Define routes using app.get() or app.post(), and start the server by calling app.listen() with a specified port. For example: const express = require('express'); const app = express(); app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello World!')); app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Perfect!
